The small drawing-room at Netherfield was, to Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s own mind, a rather less stimulating locale than a good country lane, yet here she was, enduring the polite company. Miss Bingley, positioned much too close to her brother Mr. Bingley for Elizabeth’s liking, offered a pointed observation.

“So, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,” Miss Bingley said, her tone as perfectly smooth as her gown, “I heard you walked a great many miles yesterday. Such exercise can be quite fatiguing, I should think, for a young lady.”

Elizabeth turned to her, a little smile playing on her lips. “Indeed, Miss Bingley. But I find a vigorous walk to be of great benefit to one’s spirits. My own constitution demands a certain… intrepidity, I suppose.”

Mr. Darcy, who had been standing by the mantel, turned his head almost imperceptibly at Elizabeth’s use of the word. He said nothing, but Elizabeth felt his gaze, a rather singular sensation.

“Intrepidity!” repeated Miss Bingley, her voice a shade higher. “One could call it so, I suppose. Most young ladies, however, prefer the comfort of a carriage, or at the very least, a less arduous path. Such a thing seems quite well for the peasantry, perhaps, but for our class…” She trailed off, implying the impropriety.

Mr. Bennet, who had been perusing a volume near the window, merely grunted. But Mr. Bingley, ever cheerful, brightened. “Lizzy is quite right, Caroline! A good walk clears the head. Jane often says as much.” He turned to Miss Bennet, who was engaged in tenderly flirting with a piece of embroidery. “Don’t you, my dear Miss Bennet?”

Jane looked up, her good nature shining. “Indeed, Bingley. Though I confess I have not your sister’s… stamina for such long distances.”

Elizabeth tried hard not to smile openly. “One must make one’s own amusement, Jane. Especially since the regiment went away, the diversions in Meryton have been much diminished.” She carefully avoided looking at Darcy as she spoke of the regiment, knowing the topic of Mr. Wickham was a delicate one.

Just then, Mr. Collins made his rather grand entrance, having returned from a walk to inspect some hedges. “A most excellent morning, dear cousins! I have just had the great honour of a rather extensive correspondence with my patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Her Ladyship sends her kindest regards, and makes some cheerful prognostics regarding the harvesting of the early wheat. A truly discerning woman, with such excellent taste in shrubberies, you know.”

He looked to Elizabeth, perhaps expecting admiration. She merely gave a small nod, thinking how much she preferred a truly discerning woman who possessed a little more sense and a little less pomposity. Mr. Darcy, however, still said nothing, but his eyes, she knew, missed nothing. And Miss Bingley, she felt certain, was already composing another cutting remark about Miss Elizabeth Bennet. It was, after all, her own particular talent.
