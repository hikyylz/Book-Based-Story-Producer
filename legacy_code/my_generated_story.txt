The crisp morning air at Netherfield was, to Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s mind, much improved by a walk across the park, though it did little to sweeten Miss Bingley’s disposition. Inside, in the grand drawing-room, a discussion had commenced regarding the merits of various accomplishments, to which Mr. Darcy, with his usual solemnity, contributed rather more than was strictly necessary.

“Indeed,” Miss Bingley purred, glancing from her embroidery to Elizabeth, “I know of few young ladies who possess such a *great intrepidity* of spirit as Miss Elizabeth Bennet. It is quite well known.”

“*Miss Elizabeth Bennet*?” repeated the younger Miss Bingley, with an air of delicate surprise. “Our Miss Elizabeth Bennet?”

Elizabeth, who had been attempting to conceal a smile at Mr. Bennet’s latest sally in a letter she had received only a se’nnight ago, now merely raised an eyebrow. Her own thoughts were rarely far from her face, a fact Mr. Darcy seemed to observe with more interest than he let on.

“Yes, indeed,” continued the elder Miss Bingley, affecting a gentle sigh. “Her opinions are, at times, rather singular. One must admire such independence, of course, though it does not always lead to the most — shall we say — conventional cheerful prognostics for one’s future.”

Darcy, who had been standing by the window, now turned. He had a way of looking, Elizabeth thought, that made one feel both seen and judged. She tried hard to keep her expression neutral, remembering how often his good opinion was in question.

“A young lady’s vivacity,” Mr. Darcy said, his voice deep and measured, “can be as much an asset as her quietude, if rightly directed. I have seen many instances where such spirit has made a good impression.” His gaze, though not directly upon her, seemed to encompass her entirely.

Elizabeth could not help but feel a sudden flush, a warmth that had little to do with the morning sun. The subtle tension, the tenderly flirting glance he almost seemed to send in her direction, was a new and most perplexing development. She had made her own estimations of Mr. Darcy, and they were not, as yet, entirely favourable. But his words, so contrary to Miss Bingley’s thinly veiled criticism, made her pause. She saw, in that moment, a flicker of something other, a complexity she had not fully considered. She had much to think on.
